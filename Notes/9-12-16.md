```
a[]
b[]
int[]t = a;
a = b;
b = t;
```

This swaps the code in an efficient way. It could instead try to swap the arrays element by element but that would be a lot less efficient. This is a linear time operation.

---

```
Vector[] victor = new Vector[2];
Stdout.println(Victor[0].sum() + " " + victor[1].sum());
```

This will print out a null pointer exception since the object vector hasnt been created IE it has nothing to add.

```
Vector<E>
KeyValueSet<K,V,E>;
```
This says that the values K,V,E must be objects. At best they will be objects, When it is compiled it must be a type object but when it is ran you can pass whatever you want to it.

---

```
Public Vector<E>
	Vector(E[]);
	int size();
	E valueAt(int);
```
## Class Variables:
- private final E [] \_data;

## Constants:
```
Public (E[] a){
	_data = (E[]) new Object[a.length];
	for(i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
		_data[i]=a[i];
		\_data[i]=a[i];
	}
}
```

## methods:
```
public int size(){
	return \_data.length
}
```
```
Public E valueAt(int i){
	\_rangeCheck(i);
	return \_data[i];
}
```

```
Private void \_range_check(int i){
	if(i<0 || i >= size())
		throw new IndexOutOfBoundException("foo");
}
```

`Iterable <E>` provides one method, which returns another interface which is the `interator<E>` which has a method in it called `iterator();`.
The iterator interface has 3 key methods:
	- boolean hasNext();
	- E next();
	- void remove(); *Will remove the last element*

---

## InnerClass

*In Java, just like methods, variables of a class too can have another class as its member. Writing a class within another is allowed in Java. The class written within is called the nested class, and the class that holds the inner class is called the outer class.*


`private class Vector Iterator implements Iterator<E>` is an example of a of extending an interface

---

a bag is a data type in Java where you put data in and you can't take any out. It also has no iteration format.

```
Public class Bag<E> implements Iterable<E>
Bag();
void Add(E);
int size();
Iterator<E> iterator();
```
Above is an example of a bag. If you loop through the data you will go through a random path everytime.

```
Public class queue<E> implements Iterable<E>{
	Queue();
	enqueue();
	E dequeue();
	boolean isEmpty();
	int size();
}
```
This is an example of a Generic queue

```
Public class Stack<E> implements Iterable<E>{
	public Stack();
	void push();
	E pop();
	boolean isEmpty();
	int size();
}
```
