`Enum Rank {two, Three .....}`

Knuth's algorithm randomizes elements in an array.

midterm on October 19th:
	- 1/4 true or false
	- 1/3 will me mechanics regarding algorithms (ie how does it work)
	- remainder will be similar to the creative thinking problems on the homework.

Key - something that is comparable, could be irrelevant
Stability of an algorithm - A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted. Some sorting algorithms are stable by nature like Insertion sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc. And some sorting algorithms are not, like Heap Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
## Sorting algorithms

*Selection Sort*
The basic idea is that you iterate through the unsorted array and swapping the current position with the smallest integer emelment
Below is the pseudo-code for swap
## Swap
```
Swap(a, i, j)
	input:
	a: array of items
	i, j --> positions to swap
	output: array with i, j swapped
	tmp <-- a[i]
	a[i] <-- a[j]
	a[j] <-- temp

```
Our boundary for Swap is O(N) for worst and best case
Below is the pseudo code for selection sort.
```
SelectionSort(a, n){
	a: array of items to sort
	n: length of array
	Output: natural order of items (keys)

	for i <-- 0 to N-1 do: //sorted partition of the array
		min <-- i
		for j <-- i+1 to N-1 do: // unsorted partition of the array
			if a[j] < a[min] then:
				min <-- j
			swap(a, i, min)
}
```
Best case and worst case for selection sort is O(N^2)

## Insertion sort
If you have a stream of data coming in you can sort it with Insertion sort

```
InsertionSort(a, n)
	Input:
	a - array of items
	n - number of items

	Output: Sorted array

	for i <-- 0 to N-1 do:
		j <-- i
		while j > 0 && a[j] < a[j-1] do:
			Swap(a, j, j-1)
			j <-- j-1

```
Best case this is linear O(N) since if it is already sorted the while loop with finish in N time. Worst case this is O(N^2)
