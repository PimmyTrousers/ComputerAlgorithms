## Directed Graphs
Things to note about directed graphs
1. all paths are directed ergo shortest path must respect the path direction
2. Weights are generalized values
3. Not all vertices need to be reachable
4. Negative edge weights are allowed however they introduce complexity  
5. Simple: ignore zer oedge weights that form cycles
6. parllel edges & self loops are okay
7. Shortest paths not necesarilly unique 
**See notebook for diagrams**
