## Below is a binary tree that contains tiny cat in its natural order: TINYCAT

        T
       /\
      I  Y
     /\
    C  N
   /
  A

## Below is a binary tree that contains tiny cat in an ordered order: ACINTTY
```
        A
         \
          C
           \
            I
             \
              N
               \
                T
                 \
                  T
                   \
                    Y
```

The issue with the tree above is that our tree is of height N which is slow to search and not balanced so to speak. To fix this issue we will look at 2-3 trees which are utilized to make balanced trees rather than a sorted tree like the one listed above. We will define n-node which is a node that has one or more keys related to it. It will have N links (1 key is 2 node).

        k1----k2
       /   |    \
      <    >k1   >
           &
           <k2
```
