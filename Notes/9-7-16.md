Subclassing is casting from a parent class
All classes inherit from the object class
Subtyping sets up a relationship between 2 objects
Intefaces are used for objects to inheret those functions and they are automatically part of the interface since they have the matching functions

```
interface summable {
	double sum();
}
```
for example, `vector implements summable`

if we have an object called studentGrades, it can implement summable `studentGrades implements summable`

```
class1: IntegerVector
class2: DoubleVector
```

both of these classes will implement the interface summable

The four key methods that everyone inherits from objects:
- getClass();
- toString();
- equals();
- hashCode();

*Equals asks if they point to the same object, if they have the same value but are not the same object then they will not match*

`hashCode();` will return an integer representation of that object AKA a fingerprint

```
Date d1 = new Date(2,4,1900);
Date d2 = new Date(4,11,2013);
Date d3 = new Date(2,4,1900);
	if(d1==d2){// this will be false
		 print("EQUAL");
	 }
	if(d1==d3){// this will be false
		print("EQUAL");
	}
	if(d1.equals(d3)){// this will be false
		print("EQUALS");
	}
	d3 = d1;
	if(d1.equals(d3)){// this will be true
		print("EQUALS");
	}
```

The equals method by default is the same as the double =='s.
The double equals with check if they are equal by reference AKA if they are pointing to the same memory location

But what if we want to check equality by reference?

`Override` is used to designate that you are taking the default implementation, instead of executing that run this code instead.

- if you pass `x.equals(x)` then itt must be true for all cases
- if `x.equals(y)` then `y.equals(x)` must be true
- if `x.equals(y)` and `x.equals(z)` then `z.equals(y)`

---

If you override equals incorrectly bad shit will happen. We need to define what will happen if the user passes null to the overridden function.
1. Null constraint, says that it should return false if null is passed
2. The overridden function must be consistent

An example below shows how to override a method

```
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
	if (this == obj) return true;
	if (obj == null) return false;
	if (obj instanceof Cat) {
		Cat that = (Cat)obj;
		return (this._meows == that._meows && super.equals(that));
	}
	return false;
}
```
instead of using the `instanceof` method which breaks our code we can use the `getClass()` method to fix this

```
	if (this.getClass().equals(obj.getClass())){
		return false;
	}
```

---

Listed below in an example from class

```
Cat cat = new Cat("tinycat");
Animal animal = new Animal("tinycat");
system.out.println(cat.equals(animal)); // should print false but prints true because cat is of type Animal
system.out.println(animal.equals(cat)); // should print false but prints false
```

Below is a class of IntegerSet which is an immutable type which is necessary since it will implement binary search.

```
public class IntegerSet
IntegerSet(int [])
int size()
boolean contains(int k)
```

## Binary Search
Binary search checks if it is in the middle of the data set and if it is, it will return that position. If the position is greater than the key it will throw away the other half of the search and it will take the middle of that new set and repeat that process until it finds the middle of that array

---

## Generics

generics let us implement a method for any type of data

The issue with the code below is that you are stuck with ints which limit the amount of information you can store.

```
public class Vector
public vector(int []);
int valueAt(int);
int size();
```

Listed below is the same class but as a generic which lets us pass any type of data in.

```
public class Vector<E>
public vector(E []);
E valueAt(int);
int size();
```

Listed below is an exmaple of using the generic class above

```
Date [] dates
Vector <Integer>
Vector <Date> vec = new Vector<Date>(Dates);
ivec = new Vector <integer>

```
