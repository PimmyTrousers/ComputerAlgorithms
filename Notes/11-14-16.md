## Hashcodes

if you override .equals you should probably make an implementation for hashes. That is a.equals(b) should be the same as `a.hashcode == b.Hashcodes`

```
class Transaction {
  private final String who;
  private final Date when;
  private final Double amount;
}
```

If you have objects that have consistent, well defined implementations, use them.

```
public int hashCode(){
  int hash = 17;
  hash = 31 * hash + who.hashCode();
  hash = 31 * hash + when.HashCode();
  hash = 31 * hash + amount.HashCode();
  return hash;
}
```

We want the values of our hashes to be uniformly distributed in the range of possible values. Java's latest implementation of Integer, Long, and Double of hashCode() are interesting for the following reasons. Integer's hashCode function just returns the primitive value. Long and Double takes the high 32 bits and the low 32 bits and takes the XOR of the two and returns that 32 bit as the hashcode.
