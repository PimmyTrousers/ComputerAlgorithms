**Continuing on Quick Sort.**

Below is an example of a method that returns a partition point for quick sort.

```
private static int partition(Comparable[] a, int lo, int hi){
	int i = lo, j = hi+1;
	Comparable v = a[lo];
	while (true){
		while(less(a[++i], v)) if(i == hi) break;
		while(less(v, a[--j])) if(j == lo) break;
		if(i >= j) break;
		exch(a, i, j);
	}
	// this final exchange moves our pivot into place
	exch(a, lo, j);
	return j;
}
```
Steps for deciding where to make the partition of the array

	1. let C<sub>N</sub> be the average # of compares (Nlog(N)) needed to sort N distinct keys
	2. C<sub>0</sub> = C<sub>1</sub> = 0
	3. N + 1 = partition
	4. 1/N * (The sum from n=0 to N-1 of C<sub>n</sub>)
	5. C<sub>N</sub> = N + 1 + 2/N * (The sum from n=0 to N-1 of C<sub>n</sub>)

## **For the test go over generic Java concepts**
**1.**
	- Generics <T>
	- Type erasure
	- Various common interfaces:
		- Comparable
		- Iterator
		- Iterable
	- mutable vs. immutable types
	- Basic data types:
		- bags (unordered collection)
		- queues (Gives you the ability to enqueue and dequeue FIFO)
		- stacks (Push Pop operations, LIFO)
	- Key data structures/the abstract data types
	- static vs. non static access
**2.**
	- Analysis:
		-	big O order of growth functions
		- Definition of what the Big O function is
		- Can you do a cost frequency Analysis
		- Build algorithm X from pseudocode that performs in O(something)
		- True or false questions based on their respective big O notations
**3.**
	- Sorting:
		- working with modifying, comparing and analyzing sorting algorithms
		- be familiar with:
			- insertion
			- selection
			- merge
			- quick
			- h sort (shell sort)
