Bipartite graph

To play 7 degrees of Kevin Bacon we would use breadth first search since we are trying to find the shortest path possible.

**Assumptions:**
- Connected graph
- Edge weights not equal to/ not relevant to the notion of distance.
- Can be 0 or negative
- Unique edge weights

Trees are acyclic. How can we build a tree that connects all the vertices in graph while limiting the edge weights.

**Cut Property**
- Add an edge (introducing a unique cycle)
- remove an edge (two adjacent subtrees)

**Spanning Tree**
- Connected subgraph of G with al vertices in G and no cycles
- weight of a spanning tree is the sum from i=1 to V-1 of E<sub>i</sub>

**Prim's Algorithm for graph G:**
	1. Define G<sub>r</sub> as a an initially empty graph
	2. add 1 vertex V E G to G<sub>r</sub>
	3. While V != V<sub>r</sub>, choose the minimal edge (u,w) where U is an element of V, and w is not an element of V<sub>r</sub>

**Kruskal's Algorithm**

Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest.[1] It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph adding increasing cost arcs at each step.[1] This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. If the graph is not connected, then it finds a minimum spanning forest (a minimum spanning tree for each connected component).

	1. start with G<sub>r</sub>, a forest with V trees of size 1
	2. Add edge weights in sorted order (connecting two disjoint trees), ergo reducing the forest size by 1
	3. repeat V-1 times

### *Both Kruskel's and Prim's algorithm are the same in performance time.* Both are linearithmic
