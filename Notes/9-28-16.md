- ID array of all unique objects
- Quick find
- Union operation is the drawback that limited us from calling this linear time
- Lets make union fast at the expense of the find.
Below is an implementation of find
```
find(p, id)

input: object #
output: root/component # for object P (int)

while id[p] != p do:
	p <-- id[p]
return p

```
Below is an example of the Union method
```
Union(p,q,id)
Input: p/q: objects p and q to connect (integer)
Output: // updates linkage structure

P_root <-- find(p)
q_root <-- find(q)
if P_root = q_root then:
	return
id[p_root] <-- q_root
count <-- count-1
```
**Time Analysis**

Find: 1 + depth of tree (think of it as a binary tree)
Union: The absolute best case is O(5)

**Algorithms**
Most of the algorithms that we are going to be looking at this semester will be compare based algorithms. In order to produce a sorted result we will implement a comparison operation and act upon that.
Sorting algorithms are based on the idea of a key, java uses the comparable interface on the key to put everything in an order by an ordering rule.

```
Comparable<T>
int compareTo(T t);
```
We use compareTo to compare our data types based on their natural order

1.	0 = v.compareTo(w) when v == w
		-1 = v.compareTo(w) when v < w
		1 = v.compareTo(w) when v > w

2. 	v, w must be compatible with each other. You will get an exception if they are incomparable or either value is null.

3.	Must be reflexive, transitive and symmetric

```
Public class Date implements comparable<Date>
	private int month;
	private int day;
	private int year;

	Public Date(m,d,y){
		month = m;
		day = d;
		year = y;
	}

int compareTo(Date obj){
	if(this.year > object.year){
		return 1;
	}
	if(this.year < object.year){
		return -1;
	}
	if(this.day > object.day){
		return 1;
	}
	if(this.day < object.day){
		return -1;
	}
	if(this.month > object.month){
		return 1;
	}
	if(this.month < object.month){
		return -1;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
```
Public class student implements comparable<student>{
	student (string fn, string ln);

	int compareTo(Student S){
		int val = this.ln.compareTo(s.ln);
		return val;
	}
}
```
