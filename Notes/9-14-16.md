Algorithm's to solve equations like this: (1+(2-3))

## Dijkstra's two stack algorithm
Parses tokens. Tokens are the pieces of information that are useful to you
	1. Create two stacks
	2. Read from left to right
	3. As we read, if we find an operand we will push it onto the operand stack
	4. if we read an operator we will push it onto the operator stack
	5. Ignore left parenthesis
	6. reading right parenthesis
	7. pop na operator and however many number of operands it requires
	8. perform an operation
	9. push the result onto the operand stack

*pseudo-code*
```
Operators <-- new stacks
Operands <-- new stack
.
.
.
next_item <-- read_item()
if next item is operand then:
	stack_push(operands, next_item)
```

*Example*
(1 + ((2 + 3)) * (4 * 5))
	1. 2 + 3 = 5
	2. 4 * 5 = 20
	3. 20 * 5 = 100
	4. 100 + 1 = 101

## Linked List:

```
Private class Node{
	E data;
	Node next;
}
```

---

```
import java.util.Iterator;

public class Stack<E> implements Iterable<E> {

  private Node first;   // top of the stack
  private int N;    	// # of items

  private class Node {
	E item;
	Node next;
  }

  public boolean isEmpty() { return first == null; }
  public int size() { return N; }

  public void push(E item) {

	Node oldfirst = first;
	first = new Node();
	first.item = item;
	first.next = oldfirst;
	N++;
  }

  public E pop() {
	E item = first.item;
	first = first.next;
	N--;
	return item;
  }

  public Iterator<E> iterator() { return new ListIterator(); }

  private class ListIterator implements Iterator<E> {
	private Node current = first;

    public boolean hasNext() { return current != null; }

    public E next() {
	  E item = current.item;
	  current = current.next;
	  return item;
    }

    public void remove() { /* do nothing */ }

  }
}

```

Suppose we want to implement a new constructor that takes a stack as an arg `Public Stack(Stack<E> s)`
We add a constructor to the Node object

```
public Node (Node e){
	item = e.item;
	next = new node(e.next);
	}
```

## Order of growth classification

	1. Constant ('c', '1') - Program where running time is independent of the size of operators we are running it on. Example `a + b` -> constant time
	2. Logarithmic - Running time is based on the size of input is expressed by `y = c * log(N)`, where `N` represents the input size. The log is base 2 (x^A = B --> Logx(B) = A). `Binary Search` in the IntegerSet homework is in O(log(N)) time.
	3. Linear - Order of growth is directly proportional to the input size. y = c * N. Classic single For Loop. Examples of this are copying an array by element, finding the max in an array or printing each character in a string
	4. Linearithmic - `y = c * N * log(N)` worse than linear but not as bad as quadratic.
	5. Quadratic - `y = c * N^2`, an example of this would be checking for all pairs
	6. Cubic - `y = c * N^3`, do your best to stay away from this. You do not want to deal with this unless your input is very small
	7. Exponential - `y = c * N^N` an example of this would be exhaustive search. Check all subsets.

Def: Let f(n) and g(n) be functions defined on a set of natural numbers. A function is O(g(n)) if ÆŽ 2 positive constants c and n0 so that f(n) <= c * g(n). *g(n) is the growth function*.

Prove: `T(n) = 5n + 20` is linear O(n) by getting to f(n) <= c * g(n)
	1. let n0 = 1
	2. T(n)/O(n) = (5n + 20)/n <= c for all n > 1
	3. observe `1 < n < n^2`
	4. (5n + 20n) / n <= c
	5. let c = 25
	6. 5n + 20 <= 25n which is f(n) <= c * g(n)
	7. 20 <= 20n and n > 1 therefore this is O(n)
