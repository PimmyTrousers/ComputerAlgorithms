Suppose we want to improve upon Insertion sort where we want the increment to go back h amount of steps rather than one at a time:
By this we get,
## Shell sort (h-sorting)

We introduce the notion of a gap sequence with shell sort
h = {4,2,1}
for the example above, it will h-sort by 4 then 2 then 1.
shell sort has a tilde time of, `~O(n*log(n))`
CS people like it because it offers a lot of research material on how to optimize which gap sequencing scheme to pick.
You can almost get this to compete with quick sort with some of the published optimizations. The worst case also gets improved with these optimizations by reducing the exponent from a whole number such as 2 to 1.5.

```
0		1		2		3		4		5		6
T		I		N		Y		C		A		T	(h=4)
C		I		N		Y		T		A		T	(h=4)
C		A		N		Y		T		I		T	(h=4)
C		A		N		Y		T		I		T	(h=2)
C		A		N		I		T		Y		T (h=2)
A		C		N		I		T		Y		T	(h=1)
A		C		N		I		T		Y		T	(h=1)
A		C		I		N		T		Y		T	(h=1)
A		C		I		N		T		T		Y	(h=1)
```

There is a tradeoff with algorithms of memory and time. In order to improve in order of time we might have to take a hit in space. All the sorts we have gone over so far can all be done in the space that it is defined in. There is no need to duplicate or extend the arrays. Merge sort and quick sort are examples of sorting algorithms that require either recursion which takes up memory, or creating a copy of the array which takes up extra space.

If you have an int[] of size N you will lose 4N bytes of memory space because the size of all primitives in Java is 4 bytes

	1. Harmonic Sum = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ....... + 1/N ~O(log(n))
  2. Triangular Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + ...... + N ~O((N^2)/2)
	3. Geometric Sum = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ....... + N = ~O(2N-1)
	4. N choose K  = ~O((N^K)/K!)
	5.Exponential approximation = (1-1/x)^x = ~O(1/e)

## Merge Operation and Merge Sort
Merge: takes 2 ordered arrays --> combines into 1 ordered array
```
Input = a = [2, 4, 6, 8]
				b = [1, 3, 5, 7]
Output = c = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```
Pseudo code of merge sort
```
abstract_Merge(a[], low, mid, high)
	input: array of keys, with 2 ordered partitions defined by low, mid, high
			 	 low: beginning of first partition
				 mid: end of first partition
				 high: end of the second partition

	i <-- low
	j <-- mid+1
	for k <-- low to high do:
		aux[k] <-- a[k]
	for k <-- low to high do:
		if i > mid then
			a[k] <-- aux[j]
			j <-- j+1
		else if i < mid then
			a[k] <-- aux[i]
			i <-- i+1
		else if aux[j] < aux[i] then
			a[k] <-- aux[j]
			j <-- j+1
		else do:
			a[k] <-- aux[i]
			i <-- i+1
```

Example of Merge sort:

```
a[] = [a,d,f,g,w,a,b,e,f,m]
merge(a,0,4,9)
		K		I		J		a,d,f,g,w | ,a,b,e,f,m
		0		1		5		a,d,f,g,w | ,a,b,e,f,m
		1		1		6		a,a,f,g,w | ,a,b,e,f,m
		2		1		7		a,a,b,g,w | ,a,b,e,f,m
		3		2		7		a,a,b,d,w | ,a,b,e,f,m
		4		2		8		a,a,b,d,e | ,a,b,e,f,m
```
