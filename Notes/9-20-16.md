Problems with HW 2:
	1. If you mess with the signature of the equals you will not override the equals method

Polymorphism is the idea that you can overload methods.
beware of the `Instanceof` method. It can violate symmetry.

Lets do a frequency cost analysis of Homework #2:
```
Input: Keys - array of keys
Output: New awway with dupes removed

temp_array <-- new array[length]// only done once
for i <-- 1 to length do:
	temp_array[i] <-- key[i-1];// happens N number of times
sort(temp_array);// only done once BUT the java doc says that the worst case is O(N*log(N))
pos <-- 1// only done once
for i <-- pos to length do:
	if key[i] != key[i-1] do:// happens N number of times - 1
		temp[pos] <-- key[i]// input dependent
		pos <-- pos +	1// input dependent
	a <-- new array[pos]// only done once
	for i <-- 1 to pos do:// only happens once
		a[i] <-- temp[i]
```
A: 1
B: N
C: N-1
D: X
E: Y
F: N*log(N) *Constant time*
T(N) = t0 + t1N + t2(N-1) + t3X + t4Y is the time function for this specific algorithm. By looking at this we can say that this is O(N).

## Proof of induction
Time to learn proof of induction! O_O
	1. The first step to this process is to establish a base case.
	2. create a inductive hypothesis
		a. prove it for k instances
		b. k --> k + 1

*Example with fibonacci numbers*
```
F0 = 1, F1 = 1, F2 = 2, F3 = 3, F4 = 5 . . . . Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2
i >= 1
Claim: For all i >= 1 Fib number Fi < (5/3)^i
Base case:
	i = 1
	F1 = (5/3)^1

	1 < (5/3) (This is true)
	F2 = 2 < (5/3)^2
	F2 = 2 < (25/9) (This is true)

Inductive Hypothesis:
	Assume Fi < (5/3)^i is true for all i <= k

We need to show that:
	F(k+1) < (5/3)^(k+1)

F(k+1) = F(k) + F(k-1)

Induction Step:
	F(k+1) < (5/3)^k + (5/3)^(k-1)
	F(k+1) < (3/5)(5/3)^k+1 + (9/25)*(5/3)^(k+1)
	F(k+1) < (3/5 + 9/25)(5/3)^(k+1)
	F(k+1) < (24/25)(5/3)^(k+1)
	F(k+1) < (5/3)^(k+1) --> we can do this because (24/25) is almost 1 and has a small change to the main value
```
This is an example of a problem you might do in a generic math class. Below is an example of a problem we will see in this class
```
If N >= 1, then the sum from i=1 to N, i^2 = (N(N+1)(2N+1))/6
base case:
	let N = 1
	(1)^2 = 1 = ((1)((1)+1)(2(1)+1))/6 = 6/6 = 1

Assume the claim is true for 1 <= N <= k

Our induction hypothesis is:
	sum of i=0 to N+1 of i^2 = the sum from i=1 to N of i^2 + (N+1)^2
```

## Proof of contradiction
	1. Assume the opposite is true
	2. Show some known property is false under this assumption

```
Claim: There are an infinite number of prime numbers
We assume that this claim is false E Pk where Pk is the largest prime
```
