Merge (a, lo, mid, hi)
	Input: a: array of items s.t. the partitions defined by lo, mid and hi are sorted
		Lo : start of first partition
		Mid : end of 1st partition
		Hi: end of 2nd partition

	Output: Partitions combined into one sorted partition

	I <- lo
	J <- mid + 1
	Aux <- new_array
	For k <- lo to hi do:
		Aux [k] <- a[k]

	For k <- lo to hi do:
		If i > mid then:
			A[k] <- aux[j]
			J <- j+1
		Else if j > hi then:
			A[k] <- aux [i]
			I < i+1
		Else if aux[j] < aux[i] then:
			A[k] < aux [j]
			J <- j+1
		Else do:
			A[k] <- aux[i]
			I <- i+1
```
Divide and conquer idea
First loop creates working copy
The merge operation requires additional memory
Because the merge sort is based on a merge operation it's not an in place sort

Top Down MergeSort
	Sort (a, lo, hi)
		Input: a - an array to sort
			Lo - 1st element
			Hi - last element

This has a time classification of Nlog(N) which is no better than any of the other methods we have gone over so far.
