Below is the class for Graph algorithms that we will be using for the duration of the class

```
public class Graph
  graph (int V)
  int V()
  int E()
  void addEdge(int v, int w)
  Iterable <Integer> adj(int v)
```

Below is a psuedo code implementation of a method which tells you which vertex has the max degree, that is the one that has the most amount of edges

```
GetMaxDegree(G)
  input: G - a Graph
  output: max degree of G - an Integer
  max <-- 0
  for i<--0 to G.V()-1 do:
    degree <-- 0
    edges <-- G.adj(i)
    while edges.hasNext() do:
      edges.Next()
      degree <-- degree + 1
    if degree > max then
      max <-- degree
  return max
```

The density of a graph is the measurement of how many edges the average vertex has.

"As the names indicate sparse graphs are sparsely connected (eg: Trees). Usually the number of edges is in O(n) where n is the number of vertices. Therefore adjacency lists are preferred since they require constant space for every edge.

Dense graphs are densely connected. Here number of edges is usually O(n^2). Therefore adjacency matrix is preferred.

To give a comparison, let us assume graph has 1000 vertices.

Irrespective of whether the graph is dense or sparse, adjacency matrix requires 1000^2 = 1,000,000 values to be stored.

If the graph is minimally connected (i.e. it is a tree), the adjacency list requires storing 2,997 values. If the graph is fully connected it requires storing 3,000,000 values."

Informally, a graph with relatively few edges is sparse, and a graph with many edges is dense.

## Searching in Graphs
searching in a graph from some source (vertex) give me the connected vertices

```
SearchGraph
  searchGraph(G, s)
  int count()
  boolean isConnected(int v)
```

## Depth First Search

It turns out we can modify this algorithm to answer a lot of questions about a graph.

The general approach is to visit a vertex and then recursively and visit any other other adjacent vertex that hasn't been visited yet.

```
dfs(v, marked, G)
  Input: v - vertex to visit (integer)
         marked - array designating visited vertices (boolean array)
         G - our graph
  Output: map of the connected vertices (marked array)

  marked[v] <-- true
  edges <-- G.adj(v)
  while edges.hasNext() do:
    w <-- edges.next()
    if marked[w] != true then:
      dfs(w, marked, G)
```
If you utilize this new method you can easily find the path of our vertex and save it.
```
dfs(v, marked, G, edgeTo)
  Input: v - vertex to visit (integer)
         marked - array designating visited vertices (boolean array)
         G - our graph
  Output: map of the connected vertices (marked array)

  marked[v] <-- true
  edges <-- G.adj(v)
  while edges.hasNext() do:
    w <-- edges.next()
    if marked[w] != true then:
    edgeTo[w] <-- v
      dfs(w, marked, G)
```

path(0,5) returns the path from those 2 vertices.

## Breadth first search

To implement a method that finds the shortest path between two vertices we will be using a Queue.
