Suppose we have a function T(N) that is O(N). Is my function also O(N^2)? Technically yes it is since there is a possibility that it could O(N^2) at some point.

Suppose we have a `T(N) = 8n^2 + 10n + 25`
## *Proof*
**We have 2 functions, g(n) and f(n) over natural numbers. We say f(n) is O(g(n)) if there exists 2 positive constants c and n0 such that f(n) is less than or equal to c * g(n) for all n greater than n0.**

	1. Let n0 = 1
	2. We intend to show that T(n)/G(n) <= c for all n > 1
	3. (8n^2+10n+25)/(n^2) <= c
	4. Observe 1 < n < n^2 ...
	5. we can then say that (8n^2 + 10n^2 + 25n^2)/(n^2) is going to meet T(n)/G(n) <= (8n^2 + 10n^2 + 25n^2)/(n^2) = 43
	6. let c = 43 and n0 = 1
	7. 8n^2 + 10n + 25 <= 43n^2
	8. 10n + 25 < = 35n^2
	9. We can observe again that 1 < n < n^2 so that we now know that 10n + 25 will always be less than 35n^2.

Unfortunately we might not know the T(n) for our given function. Then we would have to derive what the T(n) is by running the function itself.
A way to do this could be to define a list of N's and double the value of N every time and compare the runtime for each set of N's.

## *Use stopwatch.java to measure your functions*

Cost Frequency models will be important in this class for classifying runtime information. Another way to do it is to block your code into pieces by the frequency that they are used and figure out the runtime for each part and add it up.

Cost Frequency:
```
	1. Cost of the operation (time)
	2. Frequency (How often does it happen)
```

`summation of Cost(q)*Frequency(q)` q is the block of code that you are analyzing.

Lets build a Cost Frequency model for an example!

```
boolean isValid(String str){
	if(str.length < 2 || str.length % 2 != 0){ // this first block is only executed once
		return false; // this is executed once
	}
	int mid = str.length/2; // this is executed once
	for(int 1 = 0; i < mid; i++){ // the init is executed once but the rest is executed mutliple times
		if(str.charAt(i)!= 'a'|| str.CharAt(mid+i)!= 'b'){
			return false;
		}
	}
	return true;
}
```
We are splitting the code by the frequency, so the first section is stuff that is only happening once and the other block is the stuff that will happen multiple times. We will refer to the stuff that runs only once as A so A will only be executed once. We will refer to the stuff that runs multiple times as B and the frequency of how many times B will run is dependent on the length of the string. B executes `n/2` times and A executes 1 time. Now we can build our cost frequency model. `T(n) = t0 + (t1*N/2)` is the runtime function for this example.

```
last_coin_standing(x,y)
Input: x number of quarters
 			 y position to eliminate

Output: last remaining quarters

quarters --> new array[x] // happens one time
for i <-- 1 to x do : // happens one time
	quarters[i] <-- i // happens N number of times
length <-- x // happens one time
pos <-- 0 // happens one time
while length > i do: // excutues n-1 times
	to_remove <-- pos + y - 1 // executes n-1 times
	to_remove <-- to_remove % length // executes n-1 times
copy_pos <-- 0 // executes n-1 times
new_array <-- new array[length - 1] // executes n-1 times
for i <-- 1 to length do: // occurs D number of times
	if j - 1 != to_remove then: // happens E number of times
		new_array[copy_pos] <-- quarters[j - 1] // happens E number of times
		copy_pos <-- copy_pos+1 // occurs D number of times
	quarters <-- new_array
	length <-- length-1
	pos <-- to_remove % length
return quarters[0] // happens one time
```
A: 1 (t0)
B: N (t1)
C: N-1 (t2)
D: (N(N + 1)/2) - 1 (t3)
E: (N(N - 1)/2) (t4)

`T(N) = t0 -t2 - t3 + N(t1 + t2 + (t3/2) - (t4/2)) + N^2((t4/2) + (t3/2))`
Our tilde approximation is: `~T(N) = N^2((t4 + t3)/2)`
We say some function f(n) has some tilde `~g(n)` if `lim as N approaches infinity of f(n)/g(n) = 1`
